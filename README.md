# dApp Front-End Test

A very basic example of how to use [react and moralis](https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/react-moralis) to interact with accounts and smart contracts.

## Functionality

- Connect/Disconnect with metamask
- Display all ERC20 tokens of the user account.
- Approve an ERC20 Token by calling the smart contracts approve function (addresses and amount hardcoded for now).


Please enter your own moralis server & ID in the index.js
